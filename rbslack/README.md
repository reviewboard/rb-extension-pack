Slack Extension
===============

Overview
--------

This extension adds support for sending notifications to slack.com (a business
chat service). To set this up, you'll need to add the "Incoming WebHooks"
integration to your Slack. Once this is done, enable the extension and copy the
"Unique WebHook URL" from the integration setup instructions into the extension
configuration.
